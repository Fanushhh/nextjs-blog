Today's gym session has been very productive but also quite exhausting. In this blog post I'll dive into some details about my experience without gettin into much details but still expressing my thoughts on various aspects of the gym life.

**Arriving at the gym** is one of the things that most beginners or people with low motivation levels are struggling, it's the road to the gym process of packing your bag, planning your workout, anticipating the amount of time this will take you. **This** is a common pitfal that people find themselves into, I know I do, everybody does, we all tend to plan ahead in order to avoid surprises, but in situation where motivation is low this can hurt you because all these tasks that you calculated will weigh a lot more if you're not in the mood and seem way more difficult than they actually are. 

So one thing to remember is, and it's gonna sound stupid, just do it! Don't think it, do it and see how you feel after, I head this phrase somewhere, 'The things that are good for you don't come with regrets after' or something like that.You don't finish a gym workout or go for a run and think to yourself "Oh my god, I shouldn't have done this, it's not good for me...", you don't hate yourself for doing a difficult task at work'.
