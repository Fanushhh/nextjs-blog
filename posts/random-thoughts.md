Last week I had a session with my therapist and I was discussing some of the problems I'm struggling with, one of them being that I lack social interactions, or at least I think I am. That is because when I think about it, there aren't really a lot of people I've been keeping in touch with because I've been so busy trying to learn new things, spending time with my girlfriend and so on.

So this is something that I'm working on at the moment but I find it so hard to just "go out and make friends". The reason behind it is because I'm having a hard time coming out with topics that I can discuss with people, most of the times I think about topics, I find them stupid or not really important to them and I just give up mentally and I end up not saying anything, because hey, it's better to shut up than say something absolutely stupid, right? right?

Well apparently that's wrong, and also the reason why I'm having a hard time communicating is because even before meeting up with people I have some sort of hidden agenda, I start analyzing people and think of what they would like to hear or what the like, what they dislike and so on.

It is a very consuming thing to do and I try not to do it because mentally, the attention is shifted from me to other people, I stop thinking about what I want, like, how I feel and I just end up not doing or saying anything basically being scared shitless.
